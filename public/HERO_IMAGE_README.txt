HERO IMAGE SETUP
================

To add the hero image:
1. Download a doctor/medical professional image from Unsplash (e.g., search "doctor tablet")
2. Save it as: public/hero-doctor.jpg
3. Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger
4. The image will automatically be used in the hero section

Current setup uses a gradient fallback if the image is not present.
